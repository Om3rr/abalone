This is an an implementation of an Abalone engine for hosting a small AI competition between friends, along with an Elm frontend for playing games against the AI, debugging the AI, etc.

Important Haskell modules currently are Abalone and Player. Abalone contains logic for the game engine (updating, determining when there is a winner, etc).

To test it run `cabal test`. It has a few unit tests right now.
